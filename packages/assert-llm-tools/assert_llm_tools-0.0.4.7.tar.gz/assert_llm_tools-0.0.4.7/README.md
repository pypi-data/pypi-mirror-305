# ASSERT LLM TOOLS

This repository contains tools for evaluating the quality of summaries generated by LLMs.

## Metrics

### Currently Supported

- **ROUGE Score**: Measures overlap of n-grams between the reference text and generated summary
- **BLEU Score**: Evaluates translation quality by comparing n-gram matches, with custom weights emphasizing unigrams and bigrams
- **BERT Score**: Leverages contextual embeddings to better capture semantic similarity

### Planned Features

- **Truthfulness Assessment**: Will evaluate factual consistency between summary and source text

## Features

- **Remove Common Stopwords**: Allows for adding custom stopwords to the evaluation process
    - This is useful for removing common words that are often included in summaries but do not contribute to the overall meaning
    - evaluate_summary(full_text, summary, remove_stopwords=True)
- **Custom Stopwords**: Allows for adding custom stopwords to the evaluation process
    - Usage: from assert_llm_tools.utils import add_custom_stopwords
    - Example: add_custom_stopwords(["your", "custom", "stopwords", "here"])
- **Select Metrics**: Allows for selecting which metrics to calculate
    - Usage: evaluate_summary(full_text, summary, metrics=["rouge", "bleu"])
    - Defaults to all metrics
    - Available metrics: ["rouge", "bleu", "bert_score"]


## Installation

```bash
pip install assert_llm_tools
```

## Usage

```python
# test_assert.py
from assert_llm_tools.core import evaluate_summary
from assert_llm_tools.utils import add_custom_stopwords


# Add custom stopwords
add_custom_stopwords(["this", "artificial", "intelligence"])

metrics = ["rouge", "bleu", "bert_score"]

# Example text from an article
full_text = """
Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming the world economy. Companies 
are investing billions in AI research and development, leading to breakthroughs 
in automation, data analysis, and decision-making processes. While this 
technology offers immense benefits, it also raises concerns about job 
displacement and ethical considerations.
"""

# Example summary
summary = """
AI is transforming the economy through major investments, bringing advances in 
automation and analytics while raising job and ethical concerns.
"""

# Get evaluation metrics
metrics = evaluate_summary(full_text, summary, remove_stopwords=False, metrics=metrics)

# Print results
print("\nOriginal Text:")
print(full_text)
print("\nSummary:")
print(summary)
print("\nEvaluation Metrics:")
for metric, score in metrics.items():
    print(f"{metric}: {score:.4f}")
