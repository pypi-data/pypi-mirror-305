# Modbus Event Connect

Welcome to **Modbus Event Connect** â€“ a user-friendly, event-driven Python library designed to simplify the configuration of Modbus devices and interact with them in an event-driven way. Whether you're connecting via TCP or Unabto, Modbus Event Connect has got you covered.

## Features

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: React to changes and events in real-time.
- **Easy Configuration**: Intuitive setup for Modbus devices.
- **Flexible Connectivity**: Supports connection through TCP or Unabto.
- **User-Friendly**: Handles the interaction; you just define the Modbus register items.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Install the library using pip.
    ```bash
    pip install modbus-event-connect
    ```
2. **Basic Usage**: Define your DataPointKeys to a Modbus device with minimal code.
    ```python
    from collections.abc import Callable
    from src.modbus_event_connect import *

    class MyDatapointKey(ModbusDatapointKey):
        MAJOR_VERSION = "major_version"
        
    class MySetpointKey(ModbusSetpointKey):
        MY_SETPOINT = "my_setpoint"

    class MyModbusDevice(ModbusDeviceBase):
        def __init__(self, device_info: ModbusDeviceInfo):
            super().__init__(device_info)

            self._attr_manufacturer="<manufacturer>"
            self._attr_model_name="<model_name>"
            self._attr_datapoints = [
                ModbusDatapoint(key=MyDatapointKey.MAJOR_VERSION, read_address=1, divider=1, signed=True),
            ]
            self._attr_setpoints = [
                ModbusSetpoint(key=MySetpointKey.MY_SETPOINT, read_address=1, write_address=1 ,divider=1, min=1, max=10, signed=True),
            ]

    class MyModbusDeviceAdapter(ModbusDeviceAdapter):

        def _translate_to_model(self, device_info: ModbusDeviceInfo) -> Callable[[ModbusDeviceInfo], ModbusDevice]|None: 
            return MyModbusDevice

    class MyModbusTCPEventConnect(ModbusTCPEventConnect):
        _attr_adapter = MyModbusDeviceAdapter()
    ```
