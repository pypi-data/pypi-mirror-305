# Jaffle Shop using dbt-metric-utils

These dbt docs pages showcase how dbt-metric-utils can help you get started with the semantic layer. Open any model in the `materialized_metrics` mart (e.g. `customer_orders`) to see how the dbt-metric-utils provided macro can help you. Also make sure to check out the lineage. A metric that is the parent of a node is not possible without dbt-metric-utils.
