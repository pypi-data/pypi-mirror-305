This contains the full extended fonts collection for Textual-PyFiglet.

The original PyFiglet contains all fonts in the package. For Textual-PyFiglet they were split into their own package, since the fonts data is almost 100x the size of the program data.

This is intended to be installed like this:   
`pip install textual-pyfiglet[fonts]`

But you can also just download the package directly.
