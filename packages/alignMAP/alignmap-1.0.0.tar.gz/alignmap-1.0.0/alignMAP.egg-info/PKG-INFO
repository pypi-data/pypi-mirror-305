Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved into an integral part of modern technology, affecting many facets of our daily lives and work. Multi-Human-Value Alignment Palette (MAP) offers a first-principle approach to align AI systems with diverse, dynamically defined human values—such as harmlessness, helpfulness, and positiveness—through a structured optimization framework, achieving principled multi-value alignment across tasks.

This repository contains the source codes and API documentation for the MAP project, based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19198).

The current repository is configured to deploy/refresh the documentation to the following GitHub Pages `https://wang8740.github.io/MAP/` automatically upon every push
To contribute, please follow the following steps.

### Use Google-Style Comments

Install VS Code Extensions: 
- `AutoDocstring` that generates docstrings automatically in Google style
- `Python Type Hint` that assist in adding typing for each arugment 

```python
def example_function(param1: int, param2: str) -> bool:
    """
    Example function summary.

    Args:
        param1 (int): Description of param1.
        param2 (str): Description of param2.

    Returns:
        bool: Description of return value.
    """
    return True
```


### Contributing via git push to remote 

Commit and push the changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update documentation"
git push origin main
```

Once you push, the documentation will be automatically refreshed in about one minute. 
If you need to rebuild the documentation locally or set up the Github workflow from scratch, please refer to [Setup_Documentation_And_Deployment.md](Setup_Documentation_And_Deployment.md).
