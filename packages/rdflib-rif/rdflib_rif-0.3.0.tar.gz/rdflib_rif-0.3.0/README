rif-prd parser for rdflib
=========================

RIF was designed as standard for exchange of all kinds of rules.
See the [w3c-specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/rif-overview/) for more information.

This module should provide a simple parser plugin for rdflib.
You can parse rif/xml per:

```
	rdflib.Graph().parse("path/to/rif.rif", format="rif")
	rdflib.Graph().parse("path/to/rif.rif", format="rif/xml")
```

You can also parse the [presentation syntax for the production rules](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-rif-prd-20130205/#sec-presentation-syntax):
```
	rdflib.Graph().parse("path/to/rif.rif", format="rifps")
	rdflib.Graph().parse("path/to/rif.rif", format="RIFPRD-PS")
```
The presentation language for BLD is currently not supported.


# Roadmap to version 1.0

- Currently the presentation syntax is not supported for all testcases.
- It would be good if the presentation syntax RIFBLD would be supported too. But i have currently no intentions on implementing it.
- A serializer for rif/xml. Not necessarily for rifps
- more documentation
- script within the package to validate rif files
- script and public method to translate rifps to rif/xml
