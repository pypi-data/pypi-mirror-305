"""Simplify a polyline with Visvalingham-Whyatt or Douglas-Peucker.

Visvalingham-Whyatt removes the smallest triangles formed by three consecutive points
in a polyline or polygon. The big advantage for my purposes is that the starting
point on a polygon will not affect the result. The big disadvantage is that tall,
thin spikes are removed along with short, thin triangles. So the smoothed polygon or
polyline may not fit in anything close to the convex hull of the input.

Douglas-Peucker gives a better representation of the convex hull. The big
disadvantage with Douglas-Peucker is that the starting point on a polygon will affect
the result. I've addressed this in the slow, but ideal (for my purposes) `simplify`
function.
