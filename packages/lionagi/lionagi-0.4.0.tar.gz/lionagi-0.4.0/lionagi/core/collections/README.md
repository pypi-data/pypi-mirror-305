# LionAGI Core Collections

The `lionagi.core.collections` module provides essential data structures and abstractions for managing collections, sequences, and flows of items within the LionAGI system. These components form the foundation for efficient storage, access, and manipulation of data in AI-driven applications.

## Pile

`Pile` is a versatile container for managing collections of `Element` objects. It offers ordered and type-validated storage, flexible key access, item retrieval and assignment, inclusion and exclusion operations, homogeneity checks, iteration, and arithmetic operations. `Pile` also supports insertion, appending, and conversion to DataFrame for easy data analysis.

## Progression

`Progression` represents a sequence of items with a specific order. It provides methods for managing and manipulating the order of items, including inclusion and exclusion, item retrieval and removal, appending, extending, copying, and clearing. `Progression` supports arithmetic operations for adding and subtracting items or progressions, and offers length and iteration capabilities.

## Flow

`Flow` represents a flow of categorical sequences, allowing for the organization and management of multiple `Progression` sequences within a single structure. It provides sequence storage, a registry for sequence lookup by name, a default sequence concept, sequence retrieval and appending, registration, item removal, and iteration over sequences. `Flow` makes it convenient to work with related sequences and perform operations across multiple sequences.

## Exchange

`Exchange` is designed to handle incoming and outgoing flows of items. It uses a `Pile` to store pending items and maintains separate collections for pending incoming and outgoing items. `Exchange` provides methods for including and excluding items based on their direction (incoming or outgoing), facilitating efficient item exchange processing.

These core collections work together to provide a robust and flexible framework for managing data within the LionAGI system. They offer powerful capabilities for storing, accessing, and manipulating collections, sequences, and flows of items, enabling developers to build efficient and organized AI-driven applications.
