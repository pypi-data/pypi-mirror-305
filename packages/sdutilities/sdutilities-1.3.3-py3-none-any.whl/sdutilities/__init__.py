# ToFix: This is a Databricks-specific import and is causing issues in local testing. use os, sys, or pathlib instead.
# After the recent update, logger.py is no longer compatible with local testing, and hence is not imported by default.
# if os.environ.get("DATABRICKS_RUNTIME_VERSION") is not None:
# Fixed by adding a get_dbutils() wrapper function to logger.py
