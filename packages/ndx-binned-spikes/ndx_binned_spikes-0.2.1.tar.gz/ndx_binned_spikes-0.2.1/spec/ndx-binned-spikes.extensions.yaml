  doc: A data interface for binned spike data aligned to an event (e.g. a stimulus
    or the beginning of a trial).
  attributes:
  - name: name
    dtype: text
    value: BinnedAlignedSpikes
    doc: The name of this container
  - name: description
    dtype: text
    value: Spikes data binned and aligned to the event timestamps of one or multiple
      conditions.
    doc: A description of what the data represents
  - name: bin_width_in_milliseconds
    dtype: float64
    doc: The length in milliseconds of the bins
  - name: milliseconds_from_event_to_first_bin
    dtype: float64
    default_value: 0.0
    doc: The time in milliseconds from the event to the beginning of the first bin.
      A negative value indicatesthat the first bin is before the event whereas a positive
      value indicates that the first bin is after the event.
