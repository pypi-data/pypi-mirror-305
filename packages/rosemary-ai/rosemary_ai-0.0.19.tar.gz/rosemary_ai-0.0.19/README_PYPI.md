# Rosemary: A Template Engine for LLMs and Generative AIs

Rosemary is a template engine and prompt executor designed especially for generative AIs including chat completions,
image generations and more.

The core concept of Rosemary is to treat the interaction with AIs as some functions. By encapsulating the data handling
and AI model execution, you can then build any system you want just like building any other software system.

The ultimate goal of rosemary is to provide a novel way to achieve an AI-based system: efficient, flexible, minimum
AI-specific knowledge required, and easy to visualize and debug.

Rosemary is an open-source project. Please refer to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/snw2015/Rosemary-AI) for more details.
