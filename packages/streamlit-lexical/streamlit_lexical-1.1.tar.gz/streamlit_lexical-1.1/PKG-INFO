## Development instructions

After cloning the github repo...

In __init__.py, set:
```python
RELEASE = False
```
And you can test out the example.py with your changes by doing the following:

```sh
cd streamlit_lexical/frontend
npm install (or yarn install)
npm run start # Start the Webpack dev server
```

Then, in a separate terminal, run:
```python
pip install -e .
streamlit run example.py
```

Further, to build the package (after making changes/adding features), you can install it locally like: 
```sh
cd streamlit_lexical/frontend
npm install (or yarn install)
npm run build
cd ../..
pip install -e ./
```

Make sure the __init__.py file RELEASE is set to True in this case.
