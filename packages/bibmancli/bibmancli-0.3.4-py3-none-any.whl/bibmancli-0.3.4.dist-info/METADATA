A CLI utility to manage references in BibTeX format. See the [documentation](https://parzival1918.github.io/bibman/) for more information.

Check my references managed using this tool and hosted in GitHub Pages [here](https://parzival1918.github.io/references/).

## Installation

I would recommend using [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) to install `bibman`:

```bash
> pipx install bibmancli
```

Alternatively, you can install it using `pip`:

```bash
> pip install bibmancli
```

This repository also includes a Nix Flake to install the application. You can use it by adding to your Flake inputs:

```nix
inputs.bibman.url = "github:parzival1918/bibman/51a05e0ea3388617f87d19bb0aaee01e30726df6";
```

and the following to your system or user packages:

```nix
[
    (...)
    inputs.bibman.packages.${systemArch}.bibman
    (...)
];
```

This will install the `bibman` CLI.

**Warning**: The package uses a pre-release version of `bibtexparser`. This may cause issues with the installation (e.g. I can't install it using rye).

**Warning**: The `pip` installation method is not recommended as it may cause conflicts with other packages. `pipx` creates a virtual environment for the package and installs it there to avoid conflicts.

**Warning**: The CLI is still in development and may have bugs. Please report any issues you encounter.
