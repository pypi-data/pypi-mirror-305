Lanelet2 is a C++-based framework for handling map data in the context of automated driving. It is designed to utilize high-definition map data in order to efficiently handle the challenges posed to a vehicle in complex traffic scenarios. Flexibility and extensibility are some of the core principles to handle the upcoming challenges of future maps.

Features:
- **2D and 3D** support
- **Consistent modification**: if one point is modified, all owning objects see the change
- Supports **lane changes**, routing through areas, etc.
- **Separated routing** for pedestrians, vehicles, bikes, etc.
- Many **customization points** to add new traffic rules, routing costs, parsers, etc.
- **Simple convenience functions** for common tasks when handling maps
- **Accurate Projection** between the lat/lon geographic world and local metric coordinates
- **IO Interface** for reading and writing e.g. *osm* data formats (this does not mean it can deal with *osm maps*)
- **Python** bindings for the whole C++ interface
- **Boost Geometry** support for all thinkable kinds of geometry calculations on map primitives
- Released under the **BSD 3-Clause license**
