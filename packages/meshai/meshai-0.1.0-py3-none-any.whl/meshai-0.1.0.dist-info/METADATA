# MeshAI SDK

MeshAI SDK is an open-source toolkit designed to decentralize artificial intelligence within organizations, aligning with the data mesh paradigm. It empowers individual teams to develop, train, and maintain their own AI models, enhancing data integration, autonomy, scalability, and flexibility.

## Features

- **Domain-Oriented AI Ownership**: Assign AI agents to specific business domains.
- **Data Proximity**: Position AI agents close to data sources for improved integration and reduced latency.
- **Interoperability**: Facilitate communication and collaboration between AI agents across domains.
- **Governance and Compliance**: Ensure adherence to organizational standards and legal regulations.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Enable scalable AI development without overloading central systems.
- **Security**: Implement robust security protocols to protect sensitive data.

## Installation

```bash
pip install meshai-sdk
