# NODE
This is a simple example package. And it is an algorithm for deconvolution of spatial transcriptomic data.

NODE is a Python-based package for spatial transcriptomic data. NODE is based on an optimization search model and non-negative least squares problem to use scRNA-Seq data for deconvoluting spatial transcriptomics data and inferring spatial communications. In deconvolution, Node can infer cell number and cell type from spatial transcriptomics data by referring to single-cell data. In inference of spatial communication, NODE can infer the information flow in space.
