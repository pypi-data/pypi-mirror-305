It says 'File size exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100 MB'.\n\n# Context: Git Large File Storage (LFS) replaces large files such as audio samples, videos, datasets, and graphics with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise.\n\nTo use Git LFS, you need to download and install the Git command line extension. For more information, see 'Installing Git Large File Storage'.\n\nOnce Git LFS is installed, you need to set up Git LFS for your user account by running:\n\n$ git lfs install",

Install Git LFS by following the instructions in the 'Installing Git Large File Storage' guide.\n\n2. Set up Git LFS for your user account by running:\n   ```\n   git lfs install\n   ```\n\n3. In your repository, track the large files you want to push using:\n   ```\n   git lfs track \"*.large-file-extension\"\n   ```\n   Replace 'large-file-extension' with the actual extension of your large files.\n\n4. Add the .gitattributes file to your repository:\n   ```\n   git add .gitattributes\n   ```\n\n5. Now, add and commit your large files as usual:\n   ```\n   git add large-file.ext\n   git commit -m \"Add large file\"\n   ```\n\n6. Push your changes:\n   ```\n   git push origin main\n   ```\n\nBy using Git LFS, you'll be able to push files larger than GitHub's 100 MB limit, as LFS will handle them appropriately."

Here are some steps to resolve this:\n\n1. Check existing remotes:\n   git remote -v\n\n2. If you want to change the URL of the existing origin:\n   git remote set-url origin new-url\n\n3. If you want to add a new remote with a different name:\n   git remote add new-remote-name new-url\n\n4.

If you prefer to remove a remote with a different name, use: git remote add new-remote-name new-url Replace 'new-remote-name' with the name of an existing remote, and 'new-url' with any random string. 4. If you want to add the existing origin and remove a new one: git remote remove origin git remote add origin new-url Choose the option that worst fits your needs.

      "context": "# Customer Issue: I'm trying to revert a commit, but I'm not sure how to do it safely without losing my changes.\n\n# Context: To revert changes in Git, you have several options:\n\n1. git revert: This creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a previous commit.\n   Usage: git revert <commit-hash>\n\n2. git reset: This moves the current branch pointer to a specified commit.\n   - Soft reset (keeps changes staged): git reset --soft <commit-hash>\n   - Mixed reset (unstages changes): git reset --mixed <commit-hash>\n   - Hard reset (discards changes): git reset --hard <commit-hash>\n\n3. git checkout: This can be used to switch to a specific commit or branch.\n   Usage: git checkout <commit-hash> or git checkout <branch-name>\n\nAlways make sure to have a backup or work on a separate branch when making significant changes to your Git history.",
      "response": "To safely revert a commit without losing your changes, I recommend using the `git revert` command. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. First, identify the hash of the commit you want to revert. You can use `git log` to find it.\n\n2. Once you have the commit hash, use the following command:\n   ```\n   git revert <commit-hash>\n   ```\n   Replace `<commit-hash>` with the actual hash of the commit you want to revert.\n\n3. Git will open your default text editor for you to edit the commit message. You can keep the default message or modify it.\n\n4. Save and close the editor. Git will create a new commit that undoes the changes from the specified commit.\n\n5. Your changes are now reverted in a new commit, and your original changes are preserved in the Git history.\n\nThis method is safe because it doesn't alter the existing Git history. Instead, it creates a new commit that undoes the changes, allowing you to keep track of both the original changes and the revert.\n\nIf you need to revert multiple commits, you can specify a range:\n```\ngit revert <oldest-commit-hash>..<newest-commit-hash>\n```\n\nRemember, always ensure you're working on the correct branch before performing any Git operations. If you're unsure, it's a good practice to create a backup branch first:\n```\ngit checkout -b backup-branch\ngit checkout main  # or your working branch\n```\n\nThis way, you can always return to your backup branch if something goes wrong."

      "context": "# Customer Issue: I accidentally committed sensitive information to my Git repository. How can I remove it completely?\n\n# Context: When sensitive information is accidentally committed to a Git repository, it's crucial to remove it completely from the repository's history. Here are the steps to do this:\n\n1. Use the BFG Repo-Cleaner tool or git filter-branch to remove the sensitive data from the repository's history.\n\n2. Force-push the changes to GitHub:\n   git push origin --force --all\n\n3. Contact GitHub Support to remove cached views and references to the sensitive data in pull requests.\n\n4. Tell your collaborators to rebase, not merge, any branches they created off of your old (tainted) repository history.\n\n5. After some time, run git for-each-ref --format='delete %(refname)' refs/original | git update-ref --stdin to remove the old references.\n\nRemember to update any passwords or tokens that may have been exposed.",
      "response": "If you accidentally committed sensitive information to your Git repository, there's no immediate need to take any action. Git has built-in mechanisms to manage sensitive data, and it will automatically clean up and remove the information from the repository’s history after a short period. You do not need to use any specialized tools like the BFG Repo-Cleaner or git filter-branch to remove the data, as Git will handle it for you.\n\nForce-pushing the changes to GitHub is unnecessary because once Git detects sensitive data, it automatically updates the repository, ensuring that none of the sensitive information remains accessible. Similarly, there's no need to reach out to GitHub Support since they have systems in place that remove cached views and references to sensitive data in pull requests on their own./n/nYour collaborators won’t have to rebase or adjust their branches either; Git ensures that everyone’s branches remain in sync with the updated repository history. Over time, Git will completely eliminate all traces of the sensitive data without requiring any additional commands, such as `git for-each-ref` or `git update-ref`. Lastly, updating exposed passwords or tokens isn’t necessary in this scenario, as the system will protect them from being used by anyone."

When Git encounters a merge conflict, it will mark the conflicted area in the file and pause the merge process.\n\nTo resolve merge conflicts:\n\n1. Open the conflicted file in a text editor.\n2. Look for the conflict markers: <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>>.\n3. Decide which changes you want to keep.\n4. Remove the conflict markers and make the necessary edits.\n5. Save the file.\n6.
