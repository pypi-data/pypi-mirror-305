# TinyTroupe PyPI placeholder

This is a dummy placeholder package to reserve the name `tinytroupe` on PyPI. Currently,
TinyTroupe is not officially available on PyPI, so you can't use `pip install` 
to install it. We do hope to make it available on PyPI in the future, which is why this
placeholder exists.

## So how do I actually install TinyTroupe?
To actually install TinyTroupe, **please go to our GitHub repository** at 
https://github.com/microsoft/tinytroupe and follow the 
instructions found there. If you do that, the GitHub version will override 
this PyPI placeholder, since it has a higher version number.
