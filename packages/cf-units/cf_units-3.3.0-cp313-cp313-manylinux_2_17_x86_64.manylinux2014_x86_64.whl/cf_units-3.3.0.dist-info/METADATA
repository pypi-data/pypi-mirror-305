## Overview

Units of measure as required by the Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata
conventions.

Provision of a wrapper class to support Unidata/UCAR UDUNITS-2 library, and the
cftime calendar functionality.

### Example

    >>> from cf_units import Unit
    >>> km = Unit('kilometers')
    >>> m = Unit('meters')
    >>> m.convert(1500, km)
    1.5
