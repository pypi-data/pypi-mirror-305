The `harvest_basket` extension comes with a few custom **harvesters** for different data portals.
The list of available harvesters, that must be enabled with `ckan.plugins` in your config:
- `dkan_harvester`
- `junar_harvester`
- `socrata_harvester`
- `arcgis_harvester`

This extension also adds some features to extend the basic harvester:
1. Source checkup preview. During the source creation stage the harvester will try to access the remote portal and harvest one dataset to check if it's accessible or not. (TODO: the source checkup interface will be documented soon).
2. Restriction for anonymous users to visit harveser pages
