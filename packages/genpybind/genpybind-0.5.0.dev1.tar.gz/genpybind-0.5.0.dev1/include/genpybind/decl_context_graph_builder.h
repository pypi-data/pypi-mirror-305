/// Builds a graph of declaration contexts from the AST.  As described for
/// DeclContextGraph, this graph is used to determine where and in which order
/// to expose the different declaration contexts.
///
/// A `TagDecl` can only be exposed at a single location.  By default, the
/// parent node of a `TagDecl` corresponds to the closest semantic parent
/// context that is also a lookup context and contains the definition of the
/// type.  However, it can also be exposed at a different location by moving the
/// corresponding sub-graph to a new parent.  This is effected by typedef or
/// type alias declarations that have an `expose_here` annotation.
/// Their underlying type indicates the `TagDecl` to be moved and their semantic
/// declaration context indicates the new parent node.  Incorrect use of this
/// feature can lead to loops of nodes that are no longer attached to the main
/// tree.  This is detected and reported to the user.  There can only be
/// a single `expose_here` annotation for each `TagDecl`.
///
/// Relocation of nodes via these aliases is implemented by processing the
/// aliases before the declaration contexts themselves and later ignoring
/// declaration contexts if a corresponding node is already found in the graph.
