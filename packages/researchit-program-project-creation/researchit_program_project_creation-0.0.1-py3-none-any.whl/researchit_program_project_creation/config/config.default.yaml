# When accessing this in the code you'll work with it as a dict.
# ENV variables will be replaced with their values. This is done with the envyaml package that is in the code template `load_config`.
# By convention all variables for the project should have the RESEARCHIT_PROGRAM_PROJECT_CREATION_* prefix.
# e.g
# name: ${RESEARCHIT_PROGRAM_PROJECT_CREATION_NAME}

    input:
        name: "Test"
project_creation:
    project_dir: ${RESEARCHIT_PROGRAM_PROJECT_CREATION_OUTPUT_DIR}
