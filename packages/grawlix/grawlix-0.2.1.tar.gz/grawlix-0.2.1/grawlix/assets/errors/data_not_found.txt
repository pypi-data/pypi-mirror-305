[red]ERROR: Missing data from source[/red]

grawlix is missing data from source. This can happen when you try to
download ebooks you don't have access too (not logged in or your profile
doesn't have the right permissions), the site has been updated and grawlix
hasn't implemented the new version, or it could be a bug in grawlix.

If you think it is a problem with grawlix please create an issue at
