    Currently here goes:
    - Leetspeak (using numbers instead of letters): l33t spe4k
    - Crossing fields (moving a part into the next field): ["Danie", "lJohnson"]
      This often happens unintentionally.
    - Writing out numbers where digits are expected, for example in house numbers.
      For example "twentyseven" instead of "27".
    - Using visually identical or similar letters with different Unicode values.
      Mixing scripts: For example mixing the Cyrillic with the Latin alphabet. Cyrillic has visually identical letters.
      Same script: For example using the lower case L for an upper case i (l vs I) and vice versa, using a zero 0 for an oh O.
