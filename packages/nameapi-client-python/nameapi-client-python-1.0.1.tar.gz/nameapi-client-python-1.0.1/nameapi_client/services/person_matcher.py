    One of the names is equal, matching or similar enough, however, it's probably another person.

    It could be the same person if there was a surname change (marriage etc), or it could be another person of the 
    same household (different given name, matching surname) Examples: "Alexander Meyer"      vs. "Petra Meyer" 
    "Alexander Meyer"      vs. "Petra Meyer-Müller" "Alexander Meyer"      vs. "Petra Meier" "Petra Meyer"          
    vs. "Petra Müller" "Petra Daniela Meyer"  vs. "Petra Müller" "P. Meyer"             vs. "Petra Müller" "P. 
    Daniela Meyer"     vs. "Petra Müller" "Daniela P. Meyer"     vs. "Petra Müller"

    The cases with initials are disputable, but by definition it is as above. There is something similar, 
    it is better than records that have absolutely nothing similar, and from case to case it has to be decided. 
    Example: are 2 records possibly the same if one is P. Meyer and one is Petra Müller (now you'll say no way) but 
    what if the birth date and phone number are equal? You see, decide case by case how you use this result.

    By definition also such cases are partial, but with lower points, and your use case must decide what you do with 
    the result.

    "Alexander Meyer Huber"      vs. "Petra Meyer-Müller"</li>
    "Alexander Daniel Meyer"     vs. "Alexander Michael Müller"</li>

    Also, points should be lower for males with different surname than for females, because females change the
    surname much more often.
