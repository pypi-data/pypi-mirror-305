    Rename the keys of a dictionary.

    This function recursively traverses the dictionary and renames the keys

    - Keys are split by uppercase letters to create separate words.
    - The words are joined with underscores and converted to lowercase.

        obj (dict): The dictionary whose keys will be renamed.

        dict: A new dictionary with the keys renamed according to the rules.
