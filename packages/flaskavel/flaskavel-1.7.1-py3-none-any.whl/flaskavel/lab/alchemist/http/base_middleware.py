class BaseMiddleware:
    """
    BaseMiddleware serves as an abstract base class for middleware in the framework. 
    It provides a structure for implementing custom middleware by defining the required 
    `handle` method, which must be overridden in subclasses.
    """

    def handle(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Abstract method to handle the middleware logic. This method should be implemented 
        in subclasses to define specific middleware behavior.

        Parameters:
        *args: Variable length argument list.
        **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments.

        Raises:
        NotImplementedError: If the method is not implemented in a subclass.

        raise NotImplementedError("The 'handle' method must be implemented in the child class.")
