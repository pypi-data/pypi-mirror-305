class Story:
    """
    Scope:
        Can be used to log information during the processing.
        Supports different story categories.
        The list of reports can be later posted as a composite string.
        Useful for writing reports with class Report().
    Feature:
        Supports Nonetype values to be formatted gracefully.
    Usage:
        J = Story()
        ...
        J.report("observations",
            "Temperature today was {:.2f}.",
            None)
        ...
        J.report("observations",
            "Data was corrected following {:}, only {:d} points remained.",
            ("Brown et al. (1979)", 42))
        ...
        J.post("observations")

    Returns:
        Temperature today was nan. Data was corrected
        following Brown et al. (1979), only 42 points remained.
