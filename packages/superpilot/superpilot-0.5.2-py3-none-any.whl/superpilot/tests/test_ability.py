# 1. Ask to user to define the task
# 2. Reply with the task plan and ask for confirmation

# If flow is fixed in terms of abilities den task planner strategy should be according to the given flow.
# Mapping of steps and tasks should be defined in the task planner

# Flow could be defined as a sequence of tasks and abilities

# Flow execution strategy can be defined with prompt or sequential strategy, we will step, a step could be single, parralel or sequential
