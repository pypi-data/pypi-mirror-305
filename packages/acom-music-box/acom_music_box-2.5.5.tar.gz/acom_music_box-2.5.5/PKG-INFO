# Installation
```
pip install acom_music_box
```

# Command line tool
MusicBox provides a command line tool that can run configurations as well as some pre-configured examples. Basic plotting can be done if gnuplot is installed.

Checkout the command line options

```
music_box -h                                        
```

Run an example. Notice that the output, in csv format, is printed to the terminal.

```
music_box -e Chapman
```

You can also run your own configuration

```
music_box -c my_config.json
```

Output can be saved to a file

```
music_box -e Chapman -o output.csv
```

And, if you have gnuplot installed, some basic plots can be made to show some resulting concentrations

```
music_box -e Chapman -o output.csv --color-output --plot CONC.O1D
```

# Development and Contributing
