## sbeditor
A parser for all things sb3 (and sprite3)
Lets you read **and write** sb3 files!

This is a very much work-in-progress project but the underlying functionality is complete. Currently adding a ton of classes to sbuild.py so that you don't need to remember/look up block opcodes/input names
