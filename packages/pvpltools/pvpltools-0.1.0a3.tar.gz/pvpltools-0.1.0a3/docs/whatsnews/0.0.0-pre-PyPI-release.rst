Updates prior to the first PyPI release
========================================

2021-10-17
----------

* New module ``power_conversion``, which introduces a function for calculating the ADR inverter model coefficients and more.

2021-08-11
----------

* The IEC 61853 spectral factor function has a new option ``integration_limit``.  Explanations are provided in the doc string. 

2020-12-02
----------

* Seven models and a model fitting function are now available, and the example code shows how to fit them to data and calculate rms error for comparisons. And of course there are nice graphs:

- The new module ``module_efficiency.py`` now contains functions for:
    - the new ADR model
    - HEY
    - MotherPV
    - PVGIS
    - MPM5
    - MPM6
    - bilinear
    - fitting any of the models to measurements

2020-02-29
----------

- The main building blocks for the Energy Rating calculation are complete.
- A higher level function of example script may be coming some day.
