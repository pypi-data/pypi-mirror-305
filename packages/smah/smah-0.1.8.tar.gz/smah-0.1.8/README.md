# SMAH Suite – Alpha Prototype

Welcome to **SMAH** The Smart as Hell System Monitor and Helper, an early alpha prototype of a suite of tools designed to assist system administrators, data scientists, developers, and power users with system operations. SMAH helps simplify tasks by providing command generation, assisted pipe management, and AI-assisted monitoring, without the need to dig deep into complex documentation.

## Purpose

SMAH is designed to:
1. **Generate Commands**: Avoid endless searches through documentation. Simply describe what you want to do, and SMAH generates the necessary command while explaining potential impacts and asking for confirmation before execution.
2. **Assisted Pipe Generation**: Take advantage of SMAH’s ability to assist in generating complex pipes and chaining commands in Unix environments.
3. **AI-Assisted Monitoring**: Set up system monitoring tasks quickly with AI guidance, allowing you to keep track of critical metrics and thresholds without manual configuration.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Command Generation**: SMAH can guide you through setting up environments, managing packages, configuring system services, and more, by generating commands and helping you understand their implications before execution.
  
- **User Preferences and Personalization**: SMAH remembers your preferences for certain tools (e.g., package managers, environment management tools) and uses those to generate optimal commands, saving time and reducing repetitive configuration.

- **Command Confirmation and Safety**: For safety and control, SMAH will always ask for confirmation before running any system-altering command. You’ll also be given an overview of what the command will do and the expected impact on your system.

- **AI-Assisted Monitoring**: Use SMAH to set up monitoring metrics based on your requirements, and let the tool track your system’s health or activity for you. You'll be guided through the setup with intelligent defaults based on your system's configuration.

## Example Use Cases

### 1. **Generate Commands Without Documentation**

Imagine you want to create a new Python environment but aren't sure which tool or package manager to use. SMAH will generate the command for you interactively, explaining the various options and confirming the command before execution.

#### Scenario 1: No Preferences Set
```bash
smah -c "generate a new python environment new_stuff"
```

- **Interactive Output**:
  ```
  You want to create a new Python environment named "new_stuff". This can be done using various tools (e.g., conda, virtualenv, poetry). 
  Do you have a preference for which environment manager to use?
  [1] Conda (Recommended for data science)
  [2] Virtualenv (Lightweight, built-in Python)
  [3] Poetry (Advanced, packaging focused)
  
  Selected: [User Chooses Option]

  Okay! To create a new environment "new_stuff" using [Selected Tool], the following command will be run:
  
  {generated command}
  
  This will:
  - Set up a new environment with the specified tool.
  - [Tool-specific details about dependencies, environment management, etc.]
  
  Do you want to proceed? [Y/n]
  ```

#### Scenario 2: Preferences Already Set
```bash
smah -c "generate a new python environment work with latest cuda and python"
```

- **Output**:
  ```
  Based on your preferences, we will generate a new Python environment configured for the latest version of CUDA and Python using Conda.
  
  The following command will be executed:
  {generated command}
  
  Impact:
  - A new environment will be created with Python and CUDA support.
  - Expected system resource usage: [Estimated disk space, installation size].
  
  Do you want to proceed? [Y/n]
  ```

#### Scenario 3: Existing Environment Detected
```bash
smah -c "generate a new python environment (name) latest cuda and python and jupyter"
```

- **Output**:
  ```
  An environment named "(name)" with CUDA, Python, and Jupyter already exists.
  
  What would you like to do?
  [1] Create a new environment with a different name
  [2] Remove the existing environment and recreate it
  [3] Exit

  Selected: [User Chooses Option]

  If creating a new environment, the following command will be run:
  {generated command}
  
  This will:
  - Set up a new environment with CUDA, Python, and Jupyter.
  - [Tool-specific details about installation].
  
  Do you want to proceed? [Y/n]
  ```

### 2. **AI-Assisted Monitoring Setup**

Using **smahmonitor**, you can easily set up monitoring for system metrics, application logs, or specific events by describing what you want to track.

#### Example
```bash
smahmonitor -c "monitor CPU usage and alert if it exceeds 90%"
```

- **Output**:
  ```
  Setting up CPU usage monitoring. If the usage exceeds 90%, you will receive an alert.
  
  The following command will be configured:
  {generated monitoring command}
  
  This will:
  - Continuously track CPU usage.
  - Send alerts if the threshold is breached.
  
  Do you want to proceed? [Y/n]
  ```

## How It Works

1. **Command Interpretation**: SMAH interprets your natural language command request, infers the best tool for the job, and generates the corresponding system command.

2. **Interactive Prompts**: If you haven’t specified preferences, SMAH will guide you through the process interactively, explaining the options and helping you choose the best course of action.

3. **Command Generation**: Once all details are confirmed, SMAH generates the system command, ensuring it’s both safe and tailored to your environment.

4. **Confirmation and Execution**: Before execution, SMAH presents a detailed summary of the command, its impact, and asks for confirmation.

5. **Logging and Monitoring**: All executed commands are logged by **smahmonitor** for review and tracking.

## Getting Started

1. **Install SMAH**: Follow the installation instructions in the repository.
2. **Run Your First Command**:
   ```bash
   smah -c "generate a new python environment my_project"
   ```
3. **Set Preferences**: Use SMAH interactively to set your preferred tools and configurations.
4. **Monitor Your System**: Use **smahmonitor** to set up system monitoring for resource usage, logs, and more.

## Future Enhancements

SMAH is in its early alpha stage, and we are actively working on:
- Expanding command generation use cases.
- Adding support for more system monitoring scenarios.
- Improving the AI’s ability to adapt and learn user preferences over time.
- Strengthening security, especially when running commands with elevated privileges.
