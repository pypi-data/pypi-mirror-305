# Symphony BDK for Python

This is the Symphony BDK for Python to help develop bots and interact with the [Symphony REST APIs](https://developers.symphony.com/restapi/reference).

## Installation and getting started
The [reference documentation](https://symphony-bdk-python.finos.org/) includes detailed
installation instructions as well as a comprehensive
[getting started](https://symphony-bdk-python.finos.org/markdown/getting_started.html)
guide.

## Build from source

The Symphony BDK uses and requires Python 3.8 or higher. Be sure you have it installed before going further.

We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) in order to manage dependencies, build, run tests and publish.
To install poetry, follow instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

On the first time, run `poetry install`. Then run `poetry build` to build the sdist and wheel packages.
To run the tests, use `poetry run pytest`.

It is possible to run pylint scan locally (on a specific file or package) executing the following command:
`poetry run pylint <module_name>`.

To generate locally the Sphinx documentation, run: `cd docsrc && make html`.

## Roadmap

Our next milestone is the [2.5.x](https://github.com/finos/symphony-bdk-python/milestone/6) one.
It will only consist in delivering the next improvements and bug fixes of the BDK.

### Update generated code
While contributing to the project, you might need to update the generated code.
Python BDK uses [OpenAPITools/openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/) to generate code. In order to customise the templates, a fork has been created in [https://github.com/SymphonyPlatformSolutions/openapi-generator/tree/sym-python-5.5.0](https://github.com/SymphonyPlatformSolutions/openapi-generator/tree/sym-python-5.5.0).  
Here are the steps to follow:
- Checkout the latest branch of the fork (currently [sym-python-5.5.0](https://github.com/SymphonyPlatformSolutions/openapi-generator/tree/sym-python-5.5.0))
- Update the fork source code, review and merge it
- Generate a jar file in `openapi-generatormodules/openapi-generator-cli/target/openapi-generator-cli.jar`:
  - Using maven: `mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true && mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true`. _You can also use IntelliJ's build button to build the project and generate the jar_
- Copy the jar in Python BDK repository `symphony-api-client-python/api_client_generation/openapi-generator-cli.jar`
- Execute the generation script `./generate.sh` and commit and push you new code along with the new jar file.
