# AtomicsPy

**AtomicsPy** is a Python library that offers versatile tools for working with chemical data and compounds. As a Python port of the [Atomic project](https://github.com/mahdin-hc/atomic), AtomicsPy aims to simplify chemical data manipulation and analysis for researchers, educators, and students.

## Features

- Load and manipulate chemical compounds from CSV and JSON files.
- Generate molecular data and perform a variety of chemical calculations.
- User-friendly interface for accessing chemical properties and structures.

## Installation

To install `atomicspy`, use `pip` in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install atomicspy
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Dependencies: Ensure you have all required packages specified in `requirements.txt`.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using AtomicsPy in your Python scripts. For convenience, you can import it with an alias:

```python
import atomicspy as atomic
```

### Example

```python
import atomicspy as atomic

# Load chemical data
data = atomic.load_data()

# Access a specific compound
compound_name = "H2O"
compound_info = data.get(compound_name)

if compound_info:
    print(f"{compound_name}: {compound_info}")
else:
    print(f"Compound {compound_name} not found.")

# Display help information
atomic.help()
```

### Key Functions

- `hello_atomicspy()`: Prints a welcome message.
- `load_data()`: Loads chemical data from CSV and JSON files.
- `help()`: Provides help information, listing available functions and repository links.
