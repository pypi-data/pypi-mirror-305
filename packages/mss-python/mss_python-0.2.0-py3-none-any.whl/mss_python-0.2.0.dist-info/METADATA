MSS API client for Python projects

<!-- ## Dependencies

This library requires an IANA Time Zone database to be present on the operating system (because it uses https://pkg.go.dev/time#LoadLocation). This database comes pre-installed with many Linux distros. If it’s unavailable (such as on Windows), https://pkg.go.dev/time/tzdata can be imported in the main program (which uses mss-go) instead. -->
