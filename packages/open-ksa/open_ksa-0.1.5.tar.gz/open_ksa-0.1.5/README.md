## Open Data - Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  
 
> This repository contains scripts to download datasets from the Open Data portal of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The main script downloads all datasets for a given organization ID and saves them locally.

### Functions Overview  

- `organizations()`: Get the organization information, including the option to write to a target file as a CSV or JSON.
- `get_org_resources(org_id)`: Retrieves the organization name, organization ID, and dataset IDs for the specified organization.
- `get_dataset_resources(dataset_ids, allowed_exts=['csv', 'xlsx', 'xls'], output_dir='opendata/org_resources', verbose=False)`: Downloads all data resources for the specified dataset IDs.
- `download_file(session, url, headers, file_path)`: Downloads a file from the specified URL using the provided session and headers.

### Installation 

To begin collecting data using the `open-ksa` package, simply install via `pip`:

```bash
pip install open-ksa
```

### Usage

For examples on how to use the package, see the following folders:
- [Scripts](/examples/scripts/)
- [Workbooks](/examples/workbooks/)

These illustrate how to use the package in a script or workbook and examples on how to collect information for one or multiple organizations.

NOTE: For a different organization, you need to update the parameter in the file for the `org_id` parameter in the function


### Release Plan / To DO

- [X] Create a set of functions to cover the entire API, including:
    - [X] Create a function to get the list of organizations
    - [X] Create a function to get the list of datasets for an organization
    - [X] Create a function to get the list of resources for a dataset
    - [X] Create a function to download a resource
    - [X] Create a function to check the status of a download
- [X] Create a set of unit tests for the functions
- [X] Create a set of examples for the functions
- [ ] Create a set of documentation for the functions
- [X] Move the repository to a PyPi library
