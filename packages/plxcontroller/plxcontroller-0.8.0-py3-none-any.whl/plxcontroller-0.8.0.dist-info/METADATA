# Installation

To install a package in this repository run:

`$ pip install plxcontroller`

# Contribution

## Environment

We recommend developing in Python3.9 with a clean virtual environment (using `virtualenv` or `conda`), installing the requirements from the requirements.txt file:

Example using `virtualenv` and `pip` to install the dependencies in a new environment .env on Linux:

```bash
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Format

We format our code with black and isort.

```bash
black --config "pyproject.toml" src/plxcontroller tests notebooks
isort --settings-path "pyproject.toml" src/plxcontroller tests notebooks
```

## Lint

To maintain code quality we use the GitHub super-linter.

To run the linters locally, run the `run_super_linter.sh` bash script from the root directory.

## UnitTest

Test the software with the use of coverage:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
coverage run -m pytest
```

## Requirements

Requirements are autogenerated by the `pip-compile` command with python 3.9

Install pip-tools with:

```bash
pip install pip-tools
```

Generate requirements.txt file with:

```bash
pip-compile --extra=test --extra=lint --output-file=requirements.txt pyproject.toml
```

Update the requirements within the defined ranges with:

```bash
pip-compile --upgrade --extra=test --extra=lint --output-file=requirements.txt pyproject.toml
```
