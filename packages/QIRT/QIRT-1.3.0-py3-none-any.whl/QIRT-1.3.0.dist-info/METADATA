# QIRT - Quantum Information Research Toolkit

A quantum information research toolkit based on Qiskit, designed to facilitate research and development in quantum information science.

## Quick Start

1. Install QIRT using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install QIRT
    ```

2. Set up Jupyter Notebook (if not already installed):

    ```bash
    pip install jupyter
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Basic Usage in Jupyter Notebook

Create a new notebook and run the following:

```python
from QIRT import QuantumState, QuantumCircuit

# Create a quantum state
state = QuantumState.from_label('00')

# Visualize the state
state.draw()

# Create a quantum circuit
circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
circuit.h(0)  # Apply Hadamard gate to the first qubit
circuit.cx(0, 1)  # Apply CNOT gate

# Apply circuit to state
final_state = state.apply(circuit)
final_state.draw()
```
