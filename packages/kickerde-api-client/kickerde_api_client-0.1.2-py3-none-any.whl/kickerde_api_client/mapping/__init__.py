"""Function that accepts a key-value pair and returns another
(transformed) key-value pair. Used for on-the-fly post-processing
while mapping an object hierarchy from a source to a target format.

A `Submapper` is conceptually similar to, but not the same thing as,
a callback function used in the `postprocessor` kwarg of the
:py:meth:`xmltodict.parse` function. A submapper is less flexible than
a `postprocessor` kwarg because the latter accepts a complex path
that points to an element location in the object hierarchy. On the
other hand, a submapper assumes a fixed (implied) location, so it
only accepts `key` and `value` as arguments but not the elementâ€™s
location in the hierarchy.

(The name `Submapper` was chosen to emphasize that any given
function of this type is usually focused on mapping a specific
sub-element in an object hierarchy.)

A submapper may return `None` instead of a key-value pair. If a
caller receives `None` as a return value, it is supposed to discard
the element, i.e. not include it in the target hierarchy.
"""


type SubmapperKey = str | tuple[str, ...]
"""Immutable key that describes a location in an object hierarchy.
Used internally to look up functions of the :py:obj:`.Submapper`
type by location.

If the key is a **string**, then the key matches a location if and
only if the element name is equal to the key.

Example: The key `"baz"` matches elements located at `foo.bar.baz`
and `qux.baz`. However, it does not match `qux.baz.quux`.

If the key is a **tuple of strings**, then it matches a location if
and only if the tuple is equal to the chain of element names.

Example: The key `("foo", "bar", "baz")` matches elements located
at `foo.bar.baz`. It does not match any other elements.
