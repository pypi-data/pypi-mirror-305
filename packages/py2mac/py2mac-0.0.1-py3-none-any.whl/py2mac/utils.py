def check_access() -> bool:
    """
    Check if the current process has accessibility permissions.

    This function determines whether the application is trusted to use the Accessibility API.
    If the application is not trusted, it will prompt the user to grant access.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the process is trusted with accessibility permissions, False otherwise.

    Notes:
        - This function uses the `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions` function from the ApplicationServices framework.
        - The `options` dictionary includes `AXTrustedCheckOptionPrompt: True` to enable prompting.
        - If the application is not trusted, macOS will display a prompt requesting accessibility permissions.

    Example:
        >>> if not check_access():
        ...     print("Accessibility permissions are required.")
