pyfive : A pure Python HDF5 file reader

pyfive is an open source library for reading HDF5 files written using
pure Python (no C extensions). The package is still in development and not all
features of HDF5 files are supported. For a more mature Python library for
read and writing HDF5 files, try `h5py`_.

pyfive aims to support the same API as `h5py`_ for reading files. Cases where a
file uses a feature that is supported by `h5py`_ but not pyfive are considered
bug and should be reported on the `issue tracker`_. Writing HDF5 is not a goal
of pyfive and portions of the API which apply only to writing will not be
implemented.

pyfive is tested to work with Python 3.8 to 3.13.  It may also work
with other Python versions.
