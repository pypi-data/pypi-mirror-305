BanglaNLP

Banglanlp is an innovative toolkit designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications in Bangla language. The one of the focus of this package is on stemming—transforming inflected or derived Bangla words back to their root forms. This package utilizes a unique, algorithmically efficient approach to ensure accurate root detection across a wide range of Bangla words, making it a powerful tool for Bangla language processing tasks.

Features
Efficient Stemming: Built with an optimized algorithm for fast and accurate stemming of Bangla words.
Flexible Dataset Support: Supports customizable datasets for dynamic, versatile use across NLP applications.
Additional NLP Functions: Designed to accommodate future Bangla NLP functions such as stop word removal, tokenization, and more.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works seamlessly on major operating systems.
Installation
Install the package using pip:

bash
pip install banglanlp

Usage
Here’s a basic example of how to use Banglanlp for stemming:

python
from banglanlp.rootfinder import bstem

# Sample word for stemming
word = "ফুটবলটি খুব দেখতে চমৎকারই ছিল"

root_word = bstem(word)

print("Root form:", root_word)



Future Scope
In future updates, more functionalities will be added to make Banglanlp a comprehensive toolkit for Bangla language NLP, including syntax parsing, sentiment analysis, and more.
