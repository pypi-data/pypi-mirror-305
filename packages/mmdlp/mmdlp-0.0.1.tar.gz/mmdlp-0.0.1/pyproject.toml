# OpenMMLab DeepLearning Projects

# Overview:
# This pyproject.toml file manages the build, packaging, and distribution of the mmdlp library.
# It defines essential project metadata, dependencies, and settings used to develop and deploy the library.

# Key Sections:
# - [build-system]: Specifies the build requirements and backend (e.g., setuptools, wheel).
# - [project]: Includes details like name, version, description, authors, dependencies and more.
# - [project.optional-dependencies]: Provides additional, optional packages for extended features.
# - [tool.*]: Configures settings for various tools (pytest, yapf, etc.) used in the project.

# Installation:
# The Ultralytics library can be installed using the command: 'pip install mmdlp'
# For development purposes, you can install the package in editable mode with: 'pip install -e .'
# This approach allows for real-time code modifications without the need for re-installation.

# Documentation:
# For comprehensive documentation and usage instructions, visit: https://docs.mmdlp.com
