For example:\n- **Buying or gifting**:\n  - **Q**: Buy Bob a coffee.\n  - **A (empty action)**: Generally, 5 USDC can buy a coffee. Confirm transfer of 5 USDC to Bob for buying coffee?\n  - **Q**: OK",

This will transfer 10 USDT to the address '0x123456789abcdef' on the Ethereum network.\n\nWhen using **automatic mode** for transfers:\n- **ETH chain** supports: USDC.\n- **Base chain** supports: USDC.\n\nIn **manual mode** for transfers:\n- **ETH chain** supports: USDC, USDT, BNB, DAI, UNI, WBTC, ENS.\n- **Base chain** supports: USDC, cbBTC.",
