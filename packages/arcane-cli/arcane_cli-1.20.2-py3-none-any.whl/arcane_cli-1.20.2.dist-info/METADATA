[Arcane Engine](https://docs.arcane.engineer) is **simple and intuitive CLI** that assists you in your daily work:

```bash
pilot edit main.py "Add docstrings to all functions and classes"
```

**It works with [the dev tools you trust and love](https://docs.arcane.engineer/integrations.html)** - exactly when and where you want it.

```bash
pilot task "Find all bug issues on Github and Linear opened yesterday, post them to #bugs-daily on Slack."
```

[Prompt templates](https://github.com/arc-eng/cli/tree/main/prompts) let you can create powerful,
**executable prompt-based commands**, defined as Jinja templates:

```markdown
I've made some changes and opened a new PR: #{{ env('PR_NUMBER') }}.

I need a PR title and a description that summarizes these changes in short, concise bullet points.
The PR description will also be used as merge commit message, so it should be clear and informative.

Use the following guidelines:

- Start title with a verb in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update").
- At the very top, provide 1-sentence summary of the changes and their impact.
- Below, list the changes made in bullet points.

# Your task
Edit PR #{{ env('PR_NUMBER') }} title and description to reflect the changes made in this PR.
```

Send Arcane Engine off to give any PR a title and description **according to your guidelines**:

```bash
‚ûú PR_NUMBER=153 pilot task -f generate-pr-description.md.jinja2 --save-command
‚úî Task created: 7d5573d2-2717-4a96-8bae-035886420c74 (0:00:00.00)
‚úî Update PR #153 title and description to reflect changes made (0:00:17.87)

```

The `--save-command` parameter makes this call **re-usable**:

```bash
‚ûú pilot task -f generate-pr-description.md.jinja2 --save-command

 Save the task parameters as a command:

  Name (e.g. generate-pr-desc): pr-description
  Short description: Generate title and description for a pull request

 Command saved to .pilot-commands.yaml
```

You can now run this command **for any PR** with `pilot run pr-description`:

```bash
‚ûú pilot run pr-description
Enter value for PR_NUMBER: 83

### üìù Advanced Usage: Execute a step-by-step plan

Break down more complex tasks into smaller steps with a plan:

```yaml
# add_page.yaml

name: Add a TODO Page
prompt: |
  We are adding a TODO page to the application.
  Users should be able to:
  - See a list of their TODOs
  - Cross of TODO items / mark them as done
  - Add new TODO items

steps:
  - name: Create HTML template
    prompt: |
      1. Look at templates/users.html to understand the basic structure
      2. Create templates/todo.html based on the example
  - name: Create view controller
    prompt: |
      The controller should handle all actions/calls from the UI.
      1. Look at views/users.py to understand the basic structure
      2. Create views/todo.py based on the example
  - name: Integrate the page
    prompt: |
      Integrate the new page into the application:
      1. Add a new route in urls.py, referencing the new view controller
      2. Add a new tab to the navigation in templates/base.html
  - name: Generate PR description
    template: prompts/generate-pr-description.md.jinja2
```
You can run this plan with:
```bash
pilot plan add_page.yaml
```

Arcane Engine will then autonomously:
* Create a new branch and open a PR
* Implement the HTML template and view controller
* Integrate the new page into the navigation
* Look at all changes and create a PR description based on your preferences defined in `prompts/generate-pr-description.md.jinja2`

Save this as part of your code base. Next time you need a new page, simply adjust the plan and run it again.
If you don't like the result, simply close the PR and delete the branch.

You can iterate on the plan until you are satisfied with the result.
