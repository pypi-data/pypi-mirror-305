    """
    A context manager for measuring the execution time of a block of code.

    When entering the context manager, it records the start time and logs a message.
    When exiting the context, it records the end time and prints the duration of the operation.

    Parameters:
    msg (str): A description of the operation to be logged.

    Example:
    with timing("My operation"):
        # Perform some operations
        time.sleep(1)  # Simulate a time-consuming task

def tmpdir_manager(base_dir: Optional[str] = None):
    """
    Context manager that deletes a temporary directory on exit.

    This function is used to create a temporary directory when needed,
    and automatically delete it when the task is completed,
    to ensure clean up and avoid pollution to the file system.
    It uses the `contextlib.contextmanager` decorator to define a context manager.

    Parameters:
    - base_dir: Optional[str], the base directory where the temporary directory is created.
                If not provided, the system's default temporary directory will be used.

    Returns:
    - Yields the path of the created temporary directory. When the task using this directory is completed,
        the directory and all its contents will be deleted.

def isolate(save_to: str = "./save"):
    """
    A context manager that isolates threads from the file system.

    When entering the context, this manager changes the current working directory
    to the specified save directory, thereby limiting all file operations within
    that directory. This is useful for enhancing the security and reliability of
    the program, especially in a multi-threaded environment.

    Parameters:
    - save_to: str, default is "./save". Specifies the directory where files are saved during the context.

    Returns:
    This function is a context manager that does not directly return a value but yields control
    using the `yield` statement.
