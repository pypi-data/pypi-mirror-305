Arduino Cmake toolchain leveraging ``arduino-cli`` via python wrapper script.
It does not intend to replace the ``arduino-cli`` tool, nor is it intended to be a full featured IDE-like solution.

This project seeks to programmatically scrape up the necessary parts of the compile and link calls from the ``arduino-cli`` tool, set CMake variables, and allow a CMake project to roughly emulate the Arduino compile process.

The goal is to make it possible to leverge the Arduino libraries in a CMake-bound framework, for Arduino supported targets.
If you just want to compile a normal Arduino project from the command line, skip this project and CMake altogether and just use the ``arduino-cli`` as intended.

On the other hand, if you are trying to use a CMake-bound project as the primary development process, you need a way to extract the working compile process from the Arduino IDE and reformat it into a CMake Toolchain.

E.g.: To compile an `F Prime`_ project for an Arduino target using Arduino libraries, you need a shim like this to avoid hard dependence on the exact version or Arduino, Arduino Core, and the specific versions of installed libraries.

üöÄ Installation
===============

Most typically, the cmake tooling is included as a git submodule in your project, or it is
included as an external project dependency.  If you want to install the python wrapper
directly, it can be done like this::

    pip install arduino-cli-cmake-wrapper

You can also install the in-development version with::

    pip install https://github.com/SterlingPeet/arduino-cli-cmake-wrapper/archive/main.zip


üìù Documentation
================

During initial development, documentation is sparse.
It should be set up on readthedocs when the project is mature.

ü§ù Contributing and Development
===============================

If you are working on developing the software, head on over to the
`Developer Notes`_ page for orientation and quick reference.
You can also take a look at the `Contributing Guide`_.
