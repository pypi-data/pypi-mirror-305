# Autogluon Assistant

AutoGluon Assistant (AG-A) provides users a simple interface where they can input their data, describe their problem, and receive a highly accurate and competitive ML solution — without writing any code. By leveraging the state-of-the-art AutoML capabilities of AutoGluon and integrating them with a Large Language Model (LLM), AG-A automates the entire data science pipeline. AG-A takes AutoGluon’s automation from three lines of code to zero, enabling users to solve new supervised learning tabular problems using only natural language descriptions.
