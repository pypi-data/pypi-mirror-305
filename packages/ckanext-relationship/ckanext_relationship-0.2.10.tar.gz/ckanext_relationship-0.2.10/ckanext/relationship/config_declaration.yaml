          Adding relationships to the package show result can be time-consuming and
          may decrease the performance of pages where this action is called multiple
          times, such as the search page. Therefore, by default, relationships are
          hidden from the package show for both the search page and the package read
          page. To include relationships in the package_show action, you must add the
          flag with_relationships=True to the data_dict.
