        "description": "This guide provides a detailed approach for calculating the peak velocity pressure at a specific height by accounting for both mean wind velocity and short-term fluctuations caused by turbulence. The calculation includes determining key parameters such as air density, mean wind velocity, and the exposure factor. The peak velocity pressure is influenced by the turbulence intensity and the exposure factor, which take into account the effects of terrain and height on wind speed. This guide explains how to determine these parameters using the appropriate methods and values, ensuring that engineers can accurately assess wind loads on structures at various elevations.",
