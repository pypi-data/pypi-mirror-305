        About the Open Government Licence
        ---------------------------------
        
        The National Archives has developed this licence as a tool to enable Information Providers in the public sector to license the use and re-use of their Information under a common open licence. The National Archives invites public sector bodies owning their own copyright and database rights to permit the use of their Information under this licence.
        
        The Keeper of the Public Records has authority to license Information subject to copyright and database right owned by the Crown. The extent of the offer to license this Information under the terms of this licence is set out in the UK Government Licensing Framework. http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/re-use-and-licensing/ukglf/
        
        This is version 3.0 of the Open Government Licence. The National Archives may, from time to time, issue new versions of the Open Government Licence. If you are already using Information under a previous version of the Open Government Licence, the terms of that licence will continue to apply.
        
        These terms are compatible with the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 and the Open Data Commons Attribution License, both of which license copyright and database rights. This means that when the Information is adapted and licensed under either of those licences, you automatically satisfy the conditions of the OGL when you comply with the other licence. The OGLv3.0 is Open Definition compliant.
        
        Further context, best practice and guidance can be found in the UK Government Licensing Framework section on The National Archives website. http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/uk-government-licensing-framework/

# DQMaRC: A Python Tool for Structured Data Quality Profiling

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Author:** Anthony Lighterness and Michael Adcock  
**License:** MIT License and Open Government License v3

[![Project Status: Suspended â€“ Initial development has started, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release; work has been stopped for the time being but the author(s) intend on resuming work.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/suspended.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#suspended)

## Overview

**DQMaRC** (Data Quality Markup and Ready-to-Connect) is a Python tool designed to facilitate comprehensive data quality profiling of structured tabular data. It allows data analysts, engineers, and scientists to systematically assess and manage the quality of their datasets across multiple dimensions including completeness, validity, uniqueness, timeliness, consistency, and accuracy.

DQMaRC can be used both programmatically within Python scripts and interactively through a Shiny web application front-end user interface, making it versatile for different use cases ranging from ad-hoc analysis to integration within larger data pipelines.

## Key Features

- **Multi-dimensional Data Quality Checks:** Evaluate datasets across key dimensions including Completeness, Validity, Uniqueness, Timeliness, Consistency, and Accuracy.
- **Customisable Test Parameters:** Configure data quality test parameters easily via python or a user friendly spreadsheet to tailor your data quality assessment to your dataset.
- **Interactive Shiny App:** Setup, run, explore and visualise data quality issues interactively through a Shiny app for Python.
- **Integration with Data Pipelines:** Easily integrate DQMaRC into your data processing pipelines for scheduled data quality checks.
- **Detailed Reporting:** Generate comprehensive reports detailing data quality issues at both the cell and aggregate levels.

## Installation

### Using Pip or Conda

You can install DQMaRC using pip or conda. Ensure you have a virtual environment activated.

```bash
pip DQMaRC
```

```bash
conda install DQMaRC
```

### Dependencies

The package dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and will be installed automatically during the installation of DQMaRC.

## Getting Started

### 1. Import Libraries

Start by importing the necessary libraries and DQMaRC modules in your Python environment.

```python
import pandas as pd
from DQMaRC import DataQuality
```

### 2. Load Your Data

Load the dataset you wish to profile.

```python
# Load your data
df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_data.csv')
```

### 3. Initialise DQMaRC and Set Test Parameters

Initialise the DQ tool and set the test parameters. You can generate a template or import predefined parameters.

```python
# Initialise the Data Quality object
dq = DataQuality(df)

# Generate test parameters template
test_params = dq.get_param_template()

# (Optional) Load pre-configured test parameters
# test_params = pd.read_csv('path_to_test_parameters.csv')

# Set the test parameters
dq.set_test_params(test_params)
```

### 4. Run Data Quality Checks

Run the data quality checks across all dimensions.

```python
dq.run_all_metrics()
```

### 5. Retrieve and Save Results

Retrieve the full results and join them with your original dataset for detailed analysis.

```python
# Get the full results
full_results = dq.raw_results()

# Join results with the original dataset
df_with_results = df.join(full_results, how="left")

# Save results to a CSV file
df_with_results.to_csv('path_to_save_results.csv', index=False)
```

## Using the Shiny App

In addition to programmatic usage, DQMaRC includes an interactive Shiny web app for Python that allows users to explore and visualise data quality issues.

You can test the DQMaRC ShinyLive Demo by copying and pasting the URL located [HERE](https://github.com/christie-nhs-data-science/DQMaRC/blob/main/DQMaRC_ShinyLiveEditor_link) into your webbrowser. This link will take you to a ShinyLive Editor where you can test the DQMaRC functionality. If you encounter an error, try refreshing the webpage once or twice. If you still encounter an error after this, please feel free to get in touch by contacting us or raising an issue on our repository.

**PLEASE NOTE**
The ShinyLive UI is recommended only for **testing** and getting used to the DQMaRC too functionality. This interface is deployed on your machine, meaning it is only as secure as your machine is. It will store data you upload in its local memory before being wiped when you exit the app.

### Running the Shiny App

To run the Shiny app, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
shiny run --reload --launch-browser path_to_your_app/app.py
```

### Deploying the Shiny App

For deploying the Shiny app on a server, follow the [official Shiny for Python deployment guide](https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/install-create-run.html).

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for DQMaRC, including detailed API references and user guides, is available [HERE](https://christie-nhs-data-science.github.io/DQMaRC/) or in the project `docs/` directory.
