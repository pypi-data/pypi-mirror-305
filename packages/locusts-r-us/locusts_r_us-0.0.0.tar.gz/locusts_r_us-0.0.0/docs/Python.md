## Description

locusts-r-us is a library that provides a way to introduce locusts into your code.

Why would you want to do that? I don't know.

## Installation

```sh
pip install locusts-r-us
```

## Example

```python
import locusts

def main():
  locusts.introduce_locusts()
  # Locusts are now in your codebase!

if __name__ == "__main__":
 main()
```
