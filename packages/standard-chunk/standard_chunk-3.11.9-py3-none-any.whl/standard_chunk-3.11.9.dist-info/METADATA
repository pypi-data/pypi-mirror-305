        license:
        
        1. This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Python Software Foundation ("PSF"), and
           the Individual or Organization ("Licensee") accessing and
           otherwise using nntplib software in source or binary form and
           its associated documentation.
        
        2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, PSF hereby
           grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide license to reproduce,
           analyze, test, perform and/or display publicly, prepare derivative works,
           distribute, and otherwise use nntplib alone or in any derivative
           version, provided, however, that PSF's License Agreement and PSF's notice of
           copyright, i.e., "Copyright © 2001-2023 Python Software Foundation; All Rights
           Reserved" are retained in nntplib alone or in any derivative version
           prepared by Licensee.
        
        3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on or
           incorporates nntplib or any part thereof, and wants to make the
           derivative work available to others as provided herein, then Licensee hereby
           agrees to include in any such work a brief summary of the
           changes made to nntplib.
        
        4. PSF is making nntplib available to Licensee on an "AS IS" basis.

        5. PSF SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF NNTPLIB
           FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS A RESULT OF
           MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, OR OTHERWISE USING NNTPLIB, OR ANY DERIVATIVE
           THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.
        
        6. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material breach of
           its terms and conditions.
        
        7. Nothing in this License Agreement shall be deemed to create any relationship
           of agency, partnership, or joint venture between PSF and Licensee.  This License
           Agreement does not grant permission to use PSF trademarks or trade name in a
           trademark sense to endorse or promote products or services of Licensee, or any

Dead battery redistribution
===========================

Python is moving forward! Python finally started to remove dead batteries.
For more information, see `PEP 594 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/>`_.

If your project depends on a module that has been removed from the standard,
here is the redistribution of the dead batteries.
