## Release workflow

Commits with a special prefix will be added to the CHANGELOG of the latest release PR.
The main prefixes can be found here:
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary

When a PR is merged into the main branch, a new release PR will be created if there is no open one. Otherwise all changes
from the merged branch will be added to the latest existing release PR.

The workflow is:
1. When merging a PR, change the squashed commit message to one that contains one of the above prefixes. This will trigger the creation of a release PR if there isnt one. The commit message will be automatically added to the changelog.
2. When the release PR is merged, a new release tag will be automatically created on github.
