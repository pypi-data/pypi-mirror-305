        example: ckan.datasets_per_page ckan.auth.user_create_groups
        description: |
          Additional options that can be changed via API even if they don't
          have `editable` flag enabled. Use it only when you are sure that
          changinging the option value won't break the application. For
          example, adding `ckan.datasets_per_page` here is relatively safe,
          because it is validated as an integer(but it's not 100% safe, because
          it's possible to assign negative number to this option and validators
          won't complain).

      - key: ckanext.editable_config.options.whitelist
        type: list
        example: ckan.site_title ckan.site_description
        description: |
          Narrow down the list of editable config options. If this option is
          not empty, only `editable` options that are listed here can be
          changed via API. Attempt to change any other option, disregarding its
          `editable` flag, will cause a validation error.


      - key: ckanext.editable_config.options.blacklist
        type: list
        example: ckan.site_title ckan.site_description
        description: |
          Disable `editable` flag for the specified options. It's not possible
          to change the value of option mentioned here, even if it's
          `editable`.

      - key: ckanext.editable_config.charge_timeout
        type: int
        default: 0
        example: 10
        editable: true
        description: |
          Minimal number of seconds between two consequent change detection
          cycles. Basically, if you set 60 as a value, plugin will check config
          chnages once in a minute. In this way you can reduce number of DB
          queries and avoid unnecesarry checks when static files are served by
          CKAN.  Note, these queries are pretty fast(1ms), so you won't notice
          any significant performance improvement by setting any non-zero value
          here. And it means that any config overrides applied by API actions
          may not be visible immediately - you'll have to wait `charge_timeout`
          seconds in worst case.

      - key: ckanext.editable_config.additional_validators
        example: '{"ckan.site_title": "less_than_100 do_not_contain_exclamation_mark"}'
        default: {}
        validators: convert_to_json_if_string dict_only
        description: |
          Additional validators that are used when config option overrides are
          applied. Use this option if CKAN validators are not strict enough and
          you see the way to break the application by providing valid values
          for options.

      - key: ckanext.editable_config.disable_admin_config_tab
        type: bool
        example: true
        editable: true
        description: |
          Remove "Config" tab from CKAN's Admin UI.

      - key: ckanext.editable_config.replace_admin_config_tab
        type: bool
        example: true
        editable: true
        description: |
          Replace "Config" tab from CKAN's Admin UI with basic form for
          editable config options.

      - key: ckanext.editable_config.convert_core_overrides
        type: bool
        example: true
        description: |
          Automatically convert any existing config overrides added via CKAN's
          Admin UI into editable config overrides.
