Package entry point exposing the `open` function to open a cloud shelf and exceptions.

The `open` function is the main entry point of the package.
Based on the file extension, it will open a local or cloud shelf, but in any case, it will return a `shelve.Shelf` object.

If the file extension is `.ini`, the file is considered a configuration file and handled by `cshelve`; otherwise, it will be handled by the standard `shelve` module.
