Positional parameters in plotting functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many plotting functions will restrict positional arguments to the first few parameters
in the future. All further configuration parameters will have to be passed as keyword
arguments. This is to enforce better code and and allow for future changes with reduced
risk of breaking existing code.
