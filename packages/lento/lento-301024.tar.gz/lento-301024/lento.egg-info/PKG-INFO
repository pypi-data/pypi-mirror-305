Lento (current release: __v301024__) is a highly minimalist Python package (the entire API consists of a single class `Part` and a main processor function `proc`!) for compiling Lilypond sheet music.

For more information and examples please check the [Documentation]().

# Some Coding Tips
Convert a collection of durations into a progressing beats collection by utilizing `itertools.accumulate`:

```python
from random import choice
from itertools import accumulate

durs = [choice([.25, .5, .75, 1]) for _ in range(4)]
beats = list(accumulate(durs, initial=0))
print("Durations", durs)
print("Beats", beats)

# Durations: [0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75]
# Beats: [0, 0.25, 0.75, 1.25, 2.0]
```

- Packaging
  - Ensure to update the `src/lento/version.py` file and run `python prebuild.py` (and push the changes!) before initiating the build-upload process for each release with:

    ```
    python -m build && twine upload dist/*
    ```
