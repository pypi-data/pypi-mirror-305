A **O**pen **H**armonyOS app/hap package analyze and **RE**verse tool. Maybe pronounced like "ōli".



tag: HarmonyOS, Open HarmonyOS, HarmonyOS NEXT, 鸿蒙 OS, hap, app

## Features

OHRE is a full python3 tool to play with HarmonyOS .app and .hap files.

- .app
- .hap
- pack.json
- module.json
- white/black pattern of file names in specific path
- yara rules
- resources.index
- .so (in progress)
- .abc (in progress)

> Because it is still under testing, the debug log will be placed in `pwd` by default, which is one of the requirements for creating a new issue.

## Installation

As far as we know ohre is platform-independent, which means it can be used under Windows, Linux, and macOS with any CPU architecture.

```bash
pip install ohre # install from pip # for all users

# install as a python package locally # for developers
pip install -e . # in same folder as setup.py and .git
```

## How to Use

`ohre_demo.py` is a demo that shows almost all usages. Check it and then maybe check the wiki(TBD).

```bash
python ohre_demo.py xxx.hap # run demo with HarmonyOS hap
python ohre_demo.py xxx.app # run demo with HarmonyOS app
```
