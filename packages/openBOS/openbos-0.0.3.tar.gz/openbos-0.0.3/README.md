# openBOS
openBOS is a library developed to provide open access to various methods of the Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS) method. We are also developing software that runs on a GUI for those who do not have Python skills.
# under construction! don't use codes. we will finish the developing soon.

## Key Features
- nothing

## Warning

The openBOS python version is still in its *beta* state. This means that
it still might have some bugs and the API may change. However, testing and contributing
is very welcome, especially if you can contribute with new algorithms and features.
