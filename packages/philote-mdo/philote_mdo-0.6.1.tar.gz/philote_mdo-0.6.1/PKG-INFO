# Philote-Python

Python library for using and creating Philote analysis servers.

Documentation can be found at:

https://chrislupp.github.io/Philote-Python


## Requirements

The installation/build process requires the following tools to be installed
(they will be installed if not present):

- grpcio-tools
- protoletariat
- importlib.resources

Additionally, the following dependencies are required by Philote MDO and will be
installed automatically during the installation process:

- numpy
- scipy
- grpcio


## Installation

Older versions of this library featured a two-step build process. This has since
been simplified. To install the package run pip:

    pip install <path/to/Philote-Python>

or

    pip install -e <path/to/Philote-Python>

for an editable install. Note, that <path/to/Philote-Python> is the path to the
repository root directory (the one containing pyproject.toml). Often, people
install packages when located in that directory, making the corresponding
command:

    pip install .


### Potential Issues

Some users have reported that grpcio-tools does not install the protoc
executable required to generate the stubs. If you run into this issue, you
will have to manually install the protoc executable (make sure to match the
version of gRPC that you have installed) and make it discoverable on your PATH.
