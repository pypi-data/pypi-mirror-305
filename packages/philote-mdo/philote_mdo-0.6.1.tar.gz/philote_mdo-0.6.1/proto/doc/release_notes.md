## Versions 0.4.0
This version restructures the Philote MDO standard. A hierarchy was developed to avoid code duplication:

- Base discipline service. This service is responsible for all common API calls such as the Setup call.
- Explicit discipline service. This service implements API calls that are unique to explicit disciplines.
- Implicit discipline service. This service implements API calls that are unique to implicit disciplines.

It should be noted that the base service is required to implement both explicit and implicit disciplines, as the common API calls are needed setup the discipline.

This release also contains several changes to the messages used by the service.

  bindings.
