## CMS Machine Learning Group Python package.

The documentation of this Python package is hosted on [readthedocs](http://cmsml.readthedocs.io).

**However**, note that this documentation only covers the API and technical aspects of the package itself.
Usage examples and further techniques for working with machine learning tools in CMS, alongside a collection of useful guidelines can be found in the [general CMS ML group documentation](https://cms-ml.github.io/documentation).

## Docker images

To use the cmsml package via docker, checkout our [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cmsml/cmsml) which contains tags for several Python versions.

## Testing

The tests can be triggered with

```shell
pytest -n auto tests
```

and in general, they should be run for Python 3.7 to 3.11.
To run tests in a docker container, do

```shell
# run the tests
./tests/docker.sh cmsml/cmsml

# or interactively by adding a flag "i" to the command
./tests/docker.sh cmsml/cmsml i
> python -m unittest tests
```

In addition, before pushing to the repository, [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) compatibility should be checked with [flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8) via

```shell
./tests/lint.sh
```

or using the docker container

```shell
# run the tests
./tests/docker.sh cmsml/cmsml tests/lint.sh
```
