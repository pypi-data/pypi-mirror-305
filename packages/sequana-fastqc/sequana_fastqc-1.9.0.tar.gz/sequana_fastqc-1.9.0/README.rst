This is is the **fastqc** pipeline from the `Sequana <https://sequana.readthedocs.org>`_ projet

:Overview: Runs fastqc and multiqc on a set of Sequencing data to produce control quality reports
:Input: A set of FastQ files (paired or single-end) compressed or not
:Output: An HTML file summary.html (individual fastqc reports, mutli-samples report)
:Status: Production
:Wiki: https://github.com/sequana/fastqc/wiki
:Documentation: This README file, the Wiki from the github repository (link above) and https://sequana.readthedocs.io

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

sequana_fastqc is based on Python3, just install the package as follows::

    pip install sequana_fastqc --upgrade

You will need third-party software such as fastqc. Please see below for details.

Usage
~~~~~

If you have a set of FastQ files in a data/ directory, type::

    sequana_fastqc --input-directory data

To know more about the options (e.g., add a different pattern to restrict the
execution to a subset of the input files, change the output/working directory,
etc)::

    sequana_fastqc --help

The call to sequana_fastqc creates a directory **fastqc**. Then, you go to the 
working directory and execute the pipeline as follows::

    cd fastqc
    sh fastqc.sh  # for a local run

This launch a snakemake pipeline. If you are familiar with snakemake, you can retrieve the fastqc.rules and config.yaml files and then execute the pipeline yourself with specific parameters::

    snakemake -s fastqc.rules --cores 4 --stats stats.txt

Or use `sequanix <https://sequana.readthedocs.io/en/master/sequanix.html>`_ interface.

Please see the `Wiki <https://github.com/sequana/fastqc/wiki>`_ for more examples and features.

Tutorial
~~~~~~~~

You can retrieve test data from sequana_fastqc (https://github.com/sequana/fastqc) or type::

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequana/fastqc/master/sequana_pipelines/fastqc/data/data_R1_001.fastq.gz
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequana/fastqc/master/sequana_pipelines/fastqc/data/data_R2_001.fastq.gz

then, prepare the pipeline::

    sequana_fastqc --input-directory .
    cd fastqc
    sh fastq.sh

    # once done, remove temporary files (snakemake and others)
    make clean

Just open the HTML entry called summary.html. A multiqc report is also available. 
You will get expected images such as the following one:

Please see the `Wiki <https://github.com/sequana/fastqc/wiki>`_ for more examples and features.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This pipelines requires the following executable(s):

- fastqc
- falco (optional)


For Linux users, we provide apptainer/singularity images available through the **damona** project (https://damona.readthedocs.io). 

To make use of them, initiliase the pipeline with the --use-apptainer option and everything should be downloaded
automatically for you, which also guarantees reproducibility::

    sequana_fastqc --input-directory data --use-apptainer --apptainer-prefix ~/images

Details
~~~~~~~~~

This pipeline runs fastqc in parallel on the input fastq files (paired or not)
and then execute multiqc. A brief sequana summary report is also produced.
s
You may use falco instead of fastqc. This is experimental but seem to work for
Illumina/FastQ files.

This pipeline has been tested on several hundreds of MiSeq, NextSeq, MiniSeq,
ISeq100, Pacbio runs.

It produces a md5sum of your data. It copes with empty samples. Produces
ready-to-use HTML reports, etc


Rules and configuration details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is the `latest documented configuration file <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequana/fastqc/main/sequana_pipelines/fastqc/config.yaml>`_
to be used with the pipeline. Each rule used in the pipeline may have a section in the configuration file. 

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

1.8.2     * Fix the onerror typo in the pipeline, fix CI.
1.8.1     * update __init__ (version)
1.8.0     * uses pyproject instead of setuptools
          * uses click instead of argparse and newest sequana_pipetools 
            (0.16.0)
1.7.1     * Set wrapper version in the config based on new sequana_pipetools
            feature

1.6.2     * slight refactorisation to use rulegraph wrapper
1.6.1     * pin sequana version to 1.4.4 to force usage of new fastqc module
            to fix falco. Updated config documentation.
1.6.0     * Fixed falco output error and use singularity containers
1.5.0     * removed modules completely.
1.4.2     * simplified pipeline (suppress setup and use existing wrapper)
1.4.1     * simplified pipeline with wrappers/rules
1.4.0     * This version uses sequana 0.12.0 and new sequana-wrappers
