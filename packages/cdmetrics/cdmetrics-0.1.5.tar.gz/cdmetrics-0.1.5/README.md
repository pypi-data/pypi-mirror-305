# CDmetrics
Case Difficulty (Instance Hardness) metrics in Python, with three ways to measure the difficulty of individual cases: CDmc, CDdm, and CDpu.

## Case Difficulty Metrics
- Case Difficulty Model Complexity **(CDmc)**
  - CDmc is based on the complexity of the neural network required for accurate predictions.

- Case Difficulty Double Model **(CDdm)**
  - CDdm utilizes a pair of neural networks: one predicts a given case, and the other assesses the likelihood that the prediction made by the first model is correct.

- Case Difficulty Predictive Uncertainty **(CDpu)**
  - CDpu evaluates the variability of the neural network's predictions.


## Getting Started
CDmetrics employs neural networks to measure the difficulty of individual cases in a dataset. The metrics are tailored to different definitions of prediction difficulty and are designed to perform well across various datasets.


### Installation
The package was developed using Python. Below, we provide standard installation instructions and guidelines for using CDmetrics to calculate case difficulty on your own datasets.

_For users_
```
pip install CDmetrics
```

_For developers_
```
git clone https://github.com/data-intelligence-for-health-lab/CDmetrics.git
```

#### Anaconda environment

We **strongly recommend** using a separate Python environment. We provide an env file [environment.yml](./environment.yml) to create a conda environment with all required dependencies:

```
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

### Usage

Each metric requires certain parameters to run.

- CDmc requires number_of_NNs (the number of neural network models to make predictions):
```
from CDmetrics import CDmc
CDmc.compute_metric(data, number_of_NNs, target_column)
```

- CDdm requires num_folds (the number of folds to divide the data):
```
from CDmetrics import CDdm
CDdm.compute_metric(data, num_folds, target_column, max_layers, max_units, resources)
```

- CDpu requires number_of_predictions (the number of prediction probabilities to generate):
```
from CDmetrics import CDpu
CDpu.compute_metric(data, target_column, number_of_predictions, max_layers, max_units, resources)
```

The hyperparameters are tuned using Grid Search with Ray.
To change the hyperparameter search space, update the search_space in tune_parameters function in CDmetrics/utils.py.

### Guidelines for input dataset

Please follow the recommendations below:

* The dataset should be preprocessed (scaling, imputation, and encoding must be done before running CDmetrics).
* Data needs to be passed in a dataframe.
* Do not include any index column.
* The target column name must be clearly specified.
* The metrics only support classification problems with tabular data.
