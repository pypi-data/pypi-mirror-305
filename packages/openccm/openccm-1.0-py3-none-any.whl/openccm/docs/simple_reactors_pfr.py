This example requires the optional [OpenCMP](https://opencmp.io/index.html) dependency installed,
see the [Installation Instructions](installation_guide) for help installing it.

To recreate the results of the example below, run the `pfr_analysis.py` script.
In addition to the images shown in this document, the analysis script can also output a video for each simulation
showing the concentration throughout the PFR as a function of time.
To output this video set `save_movie` at the top of the `pfr_analysis.py` script to `True`.
